HPC Lab assignment 3
Purpose:
1. implement sample sort using MPI
    a.Point to point communication
    b.Collective Communication
    
Conclusion:
    Efficiency increases with increase in number of processors while using collective communication because of less overhead,
    however, efficiency decreases with increase in processors while using point to point due to communication overhead.
